# This file defines patterns that should not be projected to $HOME. In other
# words: Listing `foo/` here means, "Do not do anything that would create
# `~/foo/`."
#
# - Use .gitignore to keep files out of the Git repo.
# - Use .chezmoiignore to allow files in Git but keep them out of $HOME.
#
# That means this file must use filenames as they would appear in the
# destination: `.foo`, not `dot_foo`.
