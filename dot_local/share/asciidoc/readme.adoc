This directory contains my AsciiDoc stuff.

NOTE: Some includes and similar used inside this repo itself will not function properly when viewed on GitHub. They rely on actually running Asciidoctor locally.

== Usage

The "entry point", such as it is, is file://{entrypoint-path}/{entrypoint}. Include it into a document head (at the attributes level) like so.

[source,adoc,subs=attributes]
----
\include::{entrypoint-path}/{entrypoint}[]
----

[sidebar]
****
.`{entrypoint}` content
[%collapsible]
====
[source,adoc,subs=attributes]
----
include::{entrypoint-path}/{entrypoint}[]
----
====
****

file://{entrypoint-path}/highlightjs.adoc is used to override the default highlighter with highlight.js, especially useful for highlighting AsciiDoc code. It manually overrides the highlight.js version to a much, much newer one. The old built-in one (9.18.3) retains AsciiDoc's ability to add callouts to source blocks, whereas the new one doesn't.
